## Requirements
- Apply latency padding during volatile periods.
- Stagger orders and use small size layers to mitigate adverse fills.
- Avoid self-trades when running multiple instruments.

## Implementation Plan
- Extend strategy to widen spreads when volatility or latency risk is high.
- Implement queue position logic and optional order layering.

## Verification
- Simulated latency tests ensuring orders are not immediately adverse filled.

## Files Modified
- src/execution.rs
